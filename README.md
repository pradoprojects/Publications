# Phd_Artifacts
ðŸ¦…ðŸ¦…ðŸ¦… Artifacts generated during my PhD.

In this repo you will find my publications during my Ph.D.

The file [Main-publication-JSS-2018.pdf](https://github.com/pradoprojects/Phd_Artifacts/blob/main/Main-publication-JSS-2018.pdf) gives a great overview about my project and its contributions.

Overall, I identified and characterized a research problem regarding the lack of user research for testing tools. I planned, conducted, and analyzed a qualitative study of practitioners to further understand the problem in the unit testing domain. The project's results and contributions include a framework and research agenda. They serve as actionable instruments for the testing community to incorporate practical improvements in cognitive support provided by current and future testing tools. Cognitive support is a key concept in offloading the users' memory during tools usage and has a direct impact on the improvement of the user experience during the tasks performed.
